Remember FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency.",neurology,medium
How is tuberculosis treated?,"TB is treated with a combination of antibiotics (typically isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) for at least 6 months. Treatment must be completed even if symptoms improve earlier to prevent drug resistance.",pulmonology,medium
What causes chronic kidney disease?,"Main causes include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, prolonged urinary tract obstruction, and recurrent kidney infections.",nephrology,medium
What is anemia and what are its common causes?,"Anemia is a condition with insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin to carry adequate oxygen to tissues. Common causes include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic diseases, blood loss, and inherited disorders like sickle cell disease.",hematology,easy
Describe the symptoms of pneumonia.,"Pneumonia symptoms include cough (often with phlegm), fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain when breathing or coughing, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and confusion (especially in older adults).",pulmonology,easy
What is the recommended treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?,"Treatment includes lifestyle changes (weight loss, avoiding trigger foods, elevating head while sleeping), medications (antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors), and in severe cases, surgery.",gastroenterology,medium
How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?,"Diagnosis involves medical history review, mental status tests, neurological examination, brain imaging (MRI/CT), and ruling out other causes of dementia. Definitive diagnosis can only be made post-mortem.",neurology,hard
What are the risk factors for osteoporosis?,"Risk factors include age, female gender, family history, low body weight, hormonal changes (menopause), calcium/vitamin D deficiency, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, excessive alcohol, and certain medications (corticosteroids).",rheumatology,medium
Explain the pathophysiology of asthma.,"Asthma involves chronic airway inflammation with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Triggers cause bronchospasm, mucus production, and airway edema, leading to reversible airflow obstruction and symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath.",pulmonology,hard
What is the normal range for blood glucose levels?,"Fasting blood glucose: 70-100 mg/dL (normal), 100-125 mg/dL (prediabetes), ≥126 mg/dL (diabetes). Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms indicates diabetes. HbA1c <5.7% is normal, 5.7-6.4% is prediabetes, ≥6.5% is diabetes.",endocrinology,easy
How is rheumatoid arthritis different from osteoarthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing systemic inflammation affecting joints symmetrically, with morning stiffness >1 hour. Osteoarthritis is degenerative wear-and-tear affecting weight-bearing joints asymmetrically, with pain worsening with activity.",rheumatology,medium
What are the signs of dehydration?,"Signs include thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, dark yellow urine, dry skin, fatigue, dizziness, confusion. Severe dehydration may cause rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, and low blood pressure.",general,easy
What is sepsis and why is it dangerous?,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition where the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and potentially death. It's dangerous because it can rapidly progress to septic shock despite treatment.",critical_care,hard
How do statins work to lower cholesterol?,"Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This reduces cholesterol production and increases LDL receptor expression, enhancing cholesterol clearance from blood.",cardiology,hard
What are the common side effects of chemotherapy?,"Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, increased infection risk (low white blood cells), bruising/bleeding (low platelets), anemia, mouth sores, diarrhea or constipation, and peripheral neuropathy.",oncology,medium
What is diabetic ketoacidosis and how is it treated?,"DKA is a serious complication of diabetes where lack of insulin causes breakdown of fat for energy, producing ketones and causing acidosis. Treatment involves IV fluids, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement (especially potassium), and addressing underlying cause.",endocrinology,hard
How is depression diagnosed?,"Depression is diagnosed based on DSM-5 criteria: presence of 5+ symptoms (including depressed mood or loss of interest) for 2+ weeks, causing significant distress or impairment. Diagnosis requires clinical interview; scales like PHQ-9 aid assessment.",psychiatry,medium
What is the difference between viral and bacterial meningitis?,"Viral meningitis is usually milder, resolves on its own, and doesn't require specific treatment. Bacterial meningitis is more severe, potentially life-threatening, and requires immediate antibiotic treatment. CSF analysis helps differentiate: bacterial shows high white cells (neutrophils), low glucose, high protein.",neurology,hard
What are the warning signs of liver disease?,"Warning signs include jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes), abdominal pain and swelling, swelling in legs and ankles, itchy skin, dark urine, pale stool, chronic fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite.",gastroenterology,medium
How is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) managed?,"Management includes smoking cessation (most important), bronchodilators (beta-agonists, anticholinergics), inhaled corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy (if needed), vaccinations (flu, pneumococcal), and treating exacerbations.",pulmonology,medium
What is the purpose of hemoglobin A1c test?,"HbA1c measures average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months by assessing the percentage of hemoglobin with glucose attached. It's used to diagnose diabetes and monitor long-term glucose control in diabetic patients.",endocrinology,easy
What causes urinary tract infections and how are they treated?,"UTIs are typically caused by bacteria (most commonly E. coli) entering the urinary tract. Treatment involves antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or fluoroquinolones), increased fluid intake, and addressing underlying causes.",urology,easy
What is heart failure and what are its symptoms?,"Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (especially when lying down), fatigue, weakness, swelling in legs/ankles/feet, rapid or irregular heartbeat, persistent cough or wheezing, and sudden weight gain from fluid retention.",cardiology,medium
How is celiac disease diagnosed?,"Diagnosis involves blood tests for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA) while on a gluten-containing diet, followed by upper endoscopy with small intestinal biopsy showing villous atrophy. Genetic testing (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) may support diagnosis.",gastroenterology,medium
